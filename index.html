            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <h2>A simple and fun game is "rock, paper, scissors." It was a game that a lot of us used to play in
                school
                to settle conflicts or pass the time. You won't be competing against a human opponent this time;
                instead, you'll be up against a computer. For those who have never played, the rules are quite
                simple:
            </h2>
            <div class="list">
                <ul>
                    <li>If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.</li>
                    <li>If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.</li>
